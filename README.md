# VBS Demo

These are demos of VBS that I have written myself, including their binaries.
However, sometimes you may find some of them really annoying (e.g. ```DoNotOpen.vbs```), don't panic.
If you want to close the file, simply run the ```SOD.bat``` file that comes with the vbs file in the repository or simply go into the task manager and shut ```wscript.exe``` down.
Have fun!!
